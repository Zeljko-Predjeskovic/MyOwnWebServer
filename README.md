# My Own WebServer

### Overview

In this project we create our own http server with sockets and try to handle requests from a client.
Our server reads the files from the uri as path that is given in the browser. It shows the file as text 
or if it is a html file it can be present.

### Starting template:

Saving me some time, I started with a class from a tutorial.
